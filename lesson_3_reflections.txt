When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-when i am going to add a new feature and making it accessible to others and to keep it in a safe place

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- because Git commits every action no matter what so even if i had made a space Git will automicatically commits it as a change
while when i commit manually i can commit only when i need to commit
